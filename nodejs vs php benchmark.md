1.使用php 内置的web server(php >5.4)
```
$ cd ~/public_html
$ php -S localhost:8000
```
index.php
```
<?php
echo "<h1>Hello Swoole. #".rand(1000, 9999)."</h1>";
```

2.使用php的swoole扩展创建一个简单的http server
app.php
```
$http = new swoole_http_server("0.0.0.0", 9501);

$http->on('request', function ($request, $response) {
    $response->header("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8");
    $response->end("<h1>Hello Swoole. #".rand(1000, 9999)."</h1>");
});

$http->start();
```
运行方式 php app.php

3.使用nginx + php-fpm的方式
nginx配置使用https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/recipes/codeigniter/
index.php
```
<?php
echo "<h1>Hello Swoole. #".rand(1000, 9999)."</h1>";
```

4.使用nginx+php-fpm+codeigniter框架
测试环境：从codeigniter的github仓库克隆现在的代码，nginx配置同第3个测试用例

5.使用nodejs
app.js
```
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (request, response) {

       	// 发送 HTTP 头部
       	// HTTP 状态值: 200 : OK
       	// 内容类型: text/plain
       	response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});

       	// 发送响应数据 "Hello World"
       	response.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(8888);

// 终端打印如下信息
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8888/');
```
6.使用pm2 start app.js -i max 方式(脚本内容和第5个一样)

7.使用pm2 start app.js -x

8.使用nodejs + express框架
测试环境
```
$ npm install -g express-generator@4
$ express ./express.benchmark
npm start
```

测试指令
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:9501/
